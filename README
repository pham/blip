Using the Unix iptables can be confusing, blip is a simple interface that un/blocks IPs and put them in a designated chain.

./blip -block 114.80.97.88
./blip -unblock 114.80.97.88

You can pass to it multiple IPs by separating them with commas.

List the blocked IPs:

./blip -list

When you're tired of it all:

./blip -wipe
